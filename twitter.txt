@slmhktn Yahu elektrikli araba markalarından kendi elektrik motorunu üreten var mı? Varsa kaç firma? Adamların anlamadığı marka kime ait önemli olan o. Tesla, Apple kime ait? Bunların parçalarını kimin ürettiğinin önemi var mı?
@estebanbm82 No son baratos los Tesla, más adelante van a ofrecer un modelo más económico para abarcar más mercado. Pero además han sido más eficientes. Empezando porque no tienen intermediarios.  El modelo de producción la está rompiendo. Por eso esos números.
@garyblack00 How would you feel about them spinning off into a luxury brand? Like Nissan/Infiniti etc.  Surely that model has worked for decades for reasons. But maybe those don’t apply to Tesla since they have the brand established, and don’t have the same marketing/dealership structure.

@LarsJenCH79 @bgrahamdisciple So do you think he still needs to sell? This isn’t clear to me. He would only need to sell because the loans need to be repaid. Admittedly the #TSLA sp looks like it could get cut in half with FSD suspension risk/ sales (particularly China) likely to fail to meet expectations etc

@yfinanceplus @YahooFinance Im not an expert, but Tesla car prices usually go up and down depends on the cost of materials, that what Elon once said iirc but what do I know !
@YahooFinance @Pras_S Because competition... All over the world,  but China too.

 We've HAD 2 Teslas  ....now we have a different EV.

 More and more choice all the time.  We will be getting one more soon.... and it won't be a Tesla.
